            <p>
              I have been lucky enough to get the opportunity of working in both
              a big enterprise setting as well as an startup environment in my
              career of till date. I started my career at
              <em>Goldman Sachs</em> as a summer intern in the technology
              division, then joined it back as a NAPA (Technology Analyst) and
              had a very fruitful and engaging experience during my 2 years at
              Goldman. To expand my breadth in more cutting edge tech, I moved
              on to <em>Kickdrum Technologies</em> - an Austin based technology
              startup. I am currently located in Bengaluru working at Kickdrum
              India since September of 2018.
